#### **Course Overview**

Welcome to this course on **Practical Ethical Hacking**. To enjoy this course, you need nothing but a positive attitude and a desire to learn. **No prior hacking knowledge is required.**

In this course, you will learn the practical side of ethical hacking. Too many courses teach students tools and concepts that are never used in the real world. In this course, we will focus only on tools and topics that will make you successful as an ethical hacker. The course is incredibly **hands on** and will cover many foundational topics.

-----

At the end of this course, you will have a deep understanding of **external and internal network penetration testing, wireless penetration testing,** and **web application penetration testing.** All lessons taught are from a real-world experience and what has been encountered on actual engagements in the field.
