## Money
- While yes, it does pay well
	- Starting salary is usually $100k+
- This is a field that you need to be passionate about
## Easily complacent
- This is not a career that you can just "Coast" through
	- Cyber-Security is constantly changing
## Hate to Study
- Always have to stay on top of the constantly changing environment
- New vulnerabilities are always being found and released
## Passion
- If you're not passionate about this, you won't stay motivated to stay on top.
- This is a job where you have to wake up, and not be sad that you're going into work.
## Technical
- Be able to Write / Communicate
	- Be able to translate a technical explanation to a simple to understand explanation
## Introverted
- If you are not able to be occasionally extroverted
	- This probably isn't a great field for you.
